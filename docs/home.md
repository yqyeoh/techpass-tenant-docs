## What is TechPass
TechPass is an Identity & Access Management (IAM) Solution for Developer Toolchain services within the Singapore Government Technology Stack (SGTS). It is built to provide users with a seamless login experience across the entire developer toolchain. It will also allow services that are integrated with TechPass to manage access and users easily.

Head over to our [Getting Started](quickstart) section to find out how you can start using TechPass.

## Key Concepts
TechPass is powered by [Microsoft Azure AD service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/). It builds on top of Azure AD to cater to the specific requirements of the public service's development environment. It also simplifies the user experience to enable our tenants to develop their services quickly.

TechPass utilises popular open standards such as, [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) / [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) (OpenID Connect) and [SAML 2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html) (Security Assertion Markup Language), to perform authentication, authorization and access control.
