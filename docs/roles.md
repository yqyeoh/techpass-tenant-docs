# Roles
Roles helps us identify the appropriate features that should be given to a TechPass user. A user can be given for more than one role but he/she can only assume 1 role at any given time. To switch to a different role, see [Switching Roles](#switching-roles).

All users are will be given the "*User*" role by default.

## User
As a user, you will be given access your [Profile]() in TechPass portal. You will also be allowed to sign into SGTS services that are integrated with TechPass, if you have been granted permission by the service owner. 

All users are given this role by default.

## Tenant
SGTS services that are using TechPass services are called tenants. Tenants have access to features that allows them to consume services offered by TechPass. Refer to [Namespaces](namespace) for detailed guides on what you can do within a Tenant Namespace.

## Switching Roles
To switch roles, click on your name at the top right corner of the TechPass console after when you sign in and select the role that you wish to switch to.
