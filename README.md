# TechPass User Doc Repository
This is a documentation repository for TechPass, written for Documentation Portal, using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). You can find out what docsify or markdown extensions are supported [here](https://stg.docs.developer.gov.sg/docs/public/238425294/doc-portal-publisher-guide/#/).

> The repository is currently in active development and  contents will change rapidly.

## File Structure
All markdown files should live within the **/docs** folder. Each main section should be a separate markdown file by itself. If you have added a new main section, you should also update [_sidebar.md](docs/_sidebar.md) so that it will show up when the webpage is rendered.

All non-markdown files (i.e. images and sample code files) should live within the assets subfolder.
